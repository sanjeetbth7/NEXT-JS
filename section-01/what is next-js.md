> While react has only CSR (client side rendering), Next js supports 3 ways : - 
1. SSR (Sever-side Rendering)
2. CSR (Client-side Rendering)
3. Stati-site Generation and ISR(Incremental Static Regeneration)


### 1. SSR (Server-Side Rendering)

SSR generates the HTML for a page on the server **every time a user requests it**. This means the content is always up to date, but it may take slightly longer to load compared to static pages.

* ðŸ”§ **Best for:** Dynamic content like user dashboards, search pages, or personalized data.
* ðŸ§° **Example:** `getServerSideProps` in **Next.js**, **Express with EJS**, **Laravel Blade**


### 2. CSR (Client-Side Rendering)

CSR loads a minimal HTML page and uses JavaScript to fetch and display data **after the page loads** in the browser. It provides a fast experience once loaded, but the initial load may be blank or show a loading spinner.

* ðŸ”§ **Best for:** Web apps with lots of interactivity (e.g. chat apps, dashboards), where SEO isn't critical.
* ðŸ§° **Example:** **React**, **Vue**, **Angular** (without SSR)

### 3. SSG (Static Site Generation)

SSG builds HTML pages **at build time**, not at request time. These pages are fast and cached, but they donâ€™t update unless you rebuild the site, making them best for content that doesnâ€™t change often.

* ðŸ”§ **Best for:** Blogs, landing pages, documentation â€” content that rarely changes.
* ðŸ§° **Example:** `getStaticProps` in **Next.js**, **Gatsby**, **Hugo**, **Jekyll**

### 4. ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)

ISR allows you to update static content **after the site has been built**, without needing to rebuild the entire site. You can specify how often a page should be revalidated and regenerated **in the background**.

* ðŸ”§ **Best for:** E-commerce product pages, articles, or content that updates regularly but doesnâ€™t need to be real-time.
* ðŸ§° **Example:** `revalidate` option in **Next.js** (ISR is built-in)
